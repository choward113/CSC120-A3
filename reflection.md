Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
I consulted with Musa and Jiaqi

- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
I didn't attend any sessions of TA / office hours.

- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
It's more difficult than Python, and required a bit more thinking about the data types that I used. 

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
Programming languages can accomplish the same task in separate ways, and certain languages are better suited for certain tasks. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I tried to use a series of if-elif-else statements to replace the mirror words, but it ended up replacing the replaced word. In the end, I separated the replacements into three different for loops with a break statement to make sure that the replaced word wouldn't be undone.
